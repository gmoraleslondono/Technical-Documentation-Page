                <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an
                    HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich,
                    co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity to your website and enables you to create
                    dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
                    (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
                <p>The JavaScript is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine, after the HTML and CSS have been
                    assembled and put together into a web page. This ensures that the structure and style of the page
                    are already in place by the time the JavaScript starts to run.</p>

                <p>Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the
                    var keyword, followed by any name you want to call it:</p>
                <code>var myVariable = "";</code>
                <p>So why do we need variables? Well, variables are needed to do anything interesting in programming.
                    If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting
                    message or change the image displayed in an image gallery.</p>
                <p>Declarations:</p>
                <li>Var: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
                <li>let: Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                </li>
                <li> const: Declares a read-only named constant.</li>
                <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Variable</th>
                        <th>Explanation</th>
                        <th>Example</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>String</td>
                        <td>A sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, you must
                            enclose it in quote marks.</td>
                        <td><code>var myVariable = 'Bob';</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Number</td>
                        <td>A number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</td>

                        <td>Boolean</td>
                        <td>A True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords in JS, and don't need
                            quotes.</td>

                            Refer to each member of the array like this:
                            <code>myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.</code></td>

                            variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</td>
                        <td><code>var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</code>

            <article>
                <p>As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your JavaScript code that will be
                    ignored by the browser, and exist simply to provide instructions to your fellow developers on how
                    the code works (and you, if you come back to your code after six months and can't remember what you
                    did). Comments are very useful, and you should use them often, particularly for larger
                    applications. There are two types:</p>
                <li>A single line comment is written after a double forward slash (//), e.g.</li>
                <code>//I am a comment</code>
                <li>A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */, e.g.</li>
                <code>/* I am a comment */</code>

                <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol which produces a result based on two values (or variables). In

                            etc. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether

                            "is myVariable NOT equal to 3". This returns false because myVariable IS equal to 3:

                            <code>var myVariable = 3;</code>

            <article>
                <p>Conditionals are code structures which allow you to test if an expression returns true or not,
                    running alternative code revealed by its result. A very common form of conditionals is the if ...
                    else statement. For example:</p>
                <code>if (iceCream === 'chocolate') {...}</code>

            <hr>
            <article>
                <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. When you need the procedure
                    you can call a function, with the function name, instead of rewriting the entire code each time.
                    You have already seen some uses of functions above, for example:</p>
                <p>var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</p>
                <p>These function, document.querySelector, are built into the browser for you to use whenever you
                    desire.</p>
                <p>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but has parentheses — () — after it, it is
                    likely a function. Functions often take arguments — bits of data they need to do their job. These
                    go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</p>
                <p>You can also define your own functions — in this next example we write a simple function which takes
                    two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:</p>
                <code>function multiply(num1,num2) {
                var result = num1 * num2;
                return result;
                }
          </code>
                <p>Applying the function: <code>multiply(4, 7);</code></p>
                <p>The result: 28</p>

            <hr>
            <article>
                <p>Real interactivity on a website needs events. These are code structures which listen for things
                    happening in browser, running code in response. The most obvious example is the click event, which
                    is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the
                    following into your console, then click on the current webpage:</p>
                <code>
                    document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
                    alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');
                    }
